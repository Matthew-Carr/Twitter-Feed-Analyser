Welcome to my repository. This is a twitter feed analyser for making sentiment analysis predictions on a given topic. Tweets are scraped from twitter and analysed to gather opinions given a specific search term. There are two main scripts, the console and the training environment.

To use the console:
1. Clone the repository
2. From a terminal, navigate to the root directory
3. On windows, execute the command "python console.py"
4. If using linux, execute the command "python3 console.py"
