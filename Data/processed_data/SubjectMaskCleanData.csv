"a no no , kanye announces he 's running for president , and subject gets crazy with miley all in the the same night .. it 's sunday wtf"
a woman called subject a wee bitch and spat because she sat down in front of her on the
and tomorrow subject is going to be seen as ' a raging angry black women ' for calling miley out of something that she is guilty for
do you guys remember that not too long ago subject was like one of the most hated artist .. during her pink friday album
"i think subject made an ass out of herself last night . st you call the vma 's racist , nd then you perform and accept an award at the vma 's"
i 'm over here tryna do this work before classes start tomorrow and subject is being the shady bitch queen she is and i just lost all focus
kanye and subject are the reason they may have to do away with award shows . you say it 's about artists but you two always make it about you .
lost some respect for subject after that . you may be a queen in the rap world but when u start shit at an award show u look like garbage vmas
subject dead ass sat in our faces and lied to us about meek . bye <url>
"so what s good miley ? <user> ... lol subject with that fuck shit , we may as well make a song about it . hit me up . i ghost write like quentin"

<user> sat here and rewatched subject 's opening and that is all for tonight
"<user> set a reminder : october . get ready to join the celebration around alldaybreakfast , subject !"
"<user> you can always meet them on the friday shakedown as subject said that 'd be better , so it probably will be for the others ! ;)"
"<user> <user> miley & subject staged it . not only did nm break a smile , from the nd c - angle miley says ' what ' , before subject states topic"
<user> perception is /th of reality . because we perceive meek as ' not good enough ' for subject . his support looks like he is star struck
<user> are you going over auntie subject 's tomorrow ?
"<user> lol it just seems like subject like to really take things to the rd nipple . miley , mariah , kim , taylor , list goes on"
<user> _ i 'll tell you more tomorrow but miley was throwing shade at subject and subject just called her out
"<user> <user> we are n't too far apart , subject . in fact , we may be at the same point . i do n't remember if i stopped at or ."
<user> i may watch them just to see why people are saying subject called out miley lol . that was probably deserved .
<user> but people hated way before then tbh and i think it may have been directed at lil ' kim other than iggy because subject denied later
all the talk will be about subject and miley tomorrow . nothing else has been talk worthy . vmas
alone at a mcdonald 's . few vestibules away people are talking about mar 's presidency run while the other table talks about subject 's vma feud .
"and that subject and miley ' beef ' looked toooo staged , subject smiled , miley response was too instant ( like she been practisin it ) .. c'mon mtv"
ask a kid watching the vmas where they were when subject called miley out ... now ask them what happen nov ( crickets ) . sosad
azealia banks may find herself in another hot situation after she involved herself in the miley cyrus and subject ... <url>

"but miley , what is good ? i think subject needs an answer on her desk by tomorrow morning if you wanna keep ya scalp ."

"i do have some complaints about this this beautiful sunday night . first , miley handled that well . subject should be ... <url>"
"i do n't get too riled up , because subject may be dancing with miley onstage at the next awards show . vmas"
i do n't think subject 's pregnant . stomach was flat again in the side view . think she was just sticking her butt out in the st pic .
i feel like i 'm in rd grade again watching the vmas . kanye is to trump as subject is to miley .
i just realized today is sunday y' all subject and kanye were preachin to the choir
i like meek mills when he raps because he talks like a handicapped th grader ... how do he and subject hold conversations ? ? ?
i like to avoid my monday 's like miley avoided subject at the vmas
i may even include a rendition of subject 's ' death stare ' she shot at miley last night
i remember when haterade by subject pharrell and gucci was my ringtone in the th grade
"i start school tomorrow and i 'm here watching kanye rant , miley and subject go at it and tori kelly blow the roof out of the vmas"
i still think they should have let subject continue what she was going to say rather then cut her off cuz it may hurt miley 's feelings
"i still would like a subject follow , but if she followed me , she 'd just be a flop that followed me . <url>"
i thought this may have been entertaining after subject 's moment but it 's actually very painful
i was just stalking subject 's ig and now i have to work out for hours tomorrow
i wonder if they 'll cut out subject calling miley out when they air it again tomorrow
"i 'm a bit annoyed about what miley said about subject . taylor started the pop star against pop star war , subject did n't even sat her name"
i 'm literally nervous for what kanye may say tonight ... he more of a loose cannon than subject
if i rise tomorrow and there 's no sign of ) zayn throwing a public tantrum or ) subject taking over the world then i 'm checking out of life
it looks like subject may be very small in person . well small with a big butt lol .
it 's monday and i just need to know the status of this subject and miley beef ...

subject just gave this pastor a shout out but did n't attend sunday school last sunday . man please .
subject may have called miley out but miley 's messages tonight were much more powerful than any performance at the vmas
subject may have forgiven taylor ... but i still think she 's corny for what she did .
"subject may look hollywood , but you hear every bit of new york when she opens her mouth ."
subject may need a wardrobe change if she plans on winning anything else tonight . vmas

<user> _ <user> ok ... first thing first .. u got ta know the statement was n't made by subject but management and the sun
<user> <user> <user> that 's why pierrie and subject are so pale . they have n't been seeing the sun bc they 've been so shady
<user> syco / columbia have ot signed for albums and a greatest hits . that means subject has to work on the th album or else he breaks+
<user> nd person did n't respond . subject is gone but do u want calum ?
<user> no offense but subject left on the th an my organs are on the g r o u n d
<user> what gon na happen tomorrow with subject ?
<user> i believe subject 's return is due for jan so he 'll probably be at the rumble . no idea what they 'll do with hideo .
<user> <user> either way its probably true rmbr when the sun said subject was leaving and we laughed and then subject left
<user> hold on the source that said subject dumped perrie over text was also the sun and % of lm fans believe it !
<user> subject left on the th . i guess i should have added d but
<user> all i 'm thinking about is how subject left on march th rip
<user> and march is a funny month considering that will be the year anniversary since subject left
<user> actually now they 're all denying they ever believed the sun when it came to subject ..... not even they can keep up with their bs
<user> i had to drop a finger cause subject is gone and it was like march th all over again .
"<user> the sun is shit in general ! they made up bad thing about subject , the baby news , harry and ' x ' girl every day , homophobic liam"
<user> they did n't believe the sun for a single second about louis becoming a dad but they believe the sun on anything to do with subject
<user> i just do n't believe the sun bc louis and subject said not to so i 'm not believing anything until they confirm it
<user> <user> your mate should got through . after all he could sing look at subject when he st auditioned . x
"<user> if that 's true then subject has n't left the band so you 're okay . wait till march , life might fall apart , sry"
<user> you think she 's ugly only because subject may be dating her.most y' all judge them bc you want to be the one dating subject or whatever
<user> no . the sun is notorious for making up bullshit about subject including the cheating allegations .
