<user> man utd may be forced to go in for kane or even austin if they ca n't lure bigger stars to the club .
<user> <user> take potential out of the equation is s.b . really a downgrade from kane ? i do nt think so . his pace may b better suited

<user> i dreamed about katy perry dragging nicki 's back for you on sunday and it was very fatal . i hope it 's gon na happen
"<user> <user> <user> you may disagree nicki , but the facts just do n't support you . nor does the vote by all of fandom ."
<user> miley may act and be the way she is but she is a good person . nicki is the one looking for fights anywhere . embarrassing ...
<user> kasi nga diba may prejudice pa rin about black entertainers ? also miley says that nicki keeps pulling the race card--
"a no no , kanye announces he 's running for president , and nicki gets crazy with miley all in the the same night .. it 's sunday wtf"
a woman called nicki a wee bitch and spat because she sat down in front of her on the
and tomorrow nicki is going to be seen as ' a raging angry black women ' for calling miley out of something that she is guilty for
do you guys remember that not too long ago nicki was like one of the most hated artist .. during her pink friday album
"i think nicki made an ass out of herself last night . st you call the vma 's racist , nd then you perform and accept an award at the vma 's"
i 'm over here tryna do this work before classes start tomorrow and nicki is being the shady bitch queen she is and i just lost all focus
kanye and nicki are the reason they may have to do away with award shows . you say it 's about artists but you two always make it about you .
lost some respect for nicki after that . you may be a queen in the rap world but when u start shit at an award show u look like garbage vmas
nicki dead ass sat in our faces and lied to us about meek . bye <url>
"so what s good miley ? <user> ... lol nicki with that fuck shit , we may as well make a song about it . hit me up . i ghost write like quentin"
"this ai n't the st day i 've ever called nicki ignorant , fuck . i 'm on and off w/ her . its simple , & i do n't always like how she handle shit ."
y all act like nicki really finna mess up taylor 's moment ............ for the nd time again . vmas
"i 'm tweeting this for the nd time , nicki needs to realize that people do n't buy her music not because she is n't ' skinny and white'+"
"( nicki chuckled . ) so , you just got here in sun city ? <url>"
". drake , , is sean , kendrick , cole whatever u want the order to be . no idea who in that th spot ... nicki ? i 'll leave that to y' all"
st of all ... why did n't meek help nicki to the stage . i would have cussed him to filth
"st time i 've watched the vmas in years .. what , did nicki just ...."
"nd one is a trinidadian headdress i believe , which is nicki 's home country . i m silent on the other tho <url>"
<user> is she cussing out nicki ? i may need to learn how to work this tv
<user> lmao nicki can never fuck with kim . kim 's black friday diss record lyrically slaughtered nicki . what are u talkin bout ? ? ?
<user> <user> <user> nicki wrote everything drake a emotion soft ass nigga crying cause he was n't st in line my dad meek won
<user> <user> but nicki dissed her first n threw the st shots all d while copying her
<user> sat here and rewatched nicki 's opening and that is all for tonight
"<user> set a reminder : october . get ready to join the celebration around alldaybreakfast , nicki !"
"<user> you can always meet them on the friday shakedown as nicki said that 'd be better , so it probably will be for the others ! ;)"
"<user> <user> miley & nicki staged it . not only did nm break a smile , from the nd c - angle miley says ' what ' , before nicki states topic"
<user> perception is /th of reality . because we perceive meek as ' not good enough ' for nicki . his support looks like he is star struck
<user> are you going over auntie nicki 's tomorrow ?
"<user> lol it just seems like nicki like to really take things to the rd nipple . miley , mariah , kim , taylor , list goes on"
<user> _ i 'll tell you more tomorrow but miley was throwing shade at nicki and nicki just called her out
"<user> <user> we are n't too far apart , nicki . in fact , we may be at the same point . i do n't remember if i stopped at or ."
<user> i may watch them just to see why people are saying nicki called out miley lol . that was probably deserved .
<user> but people hated way before then tbh and i think it may have been directed at lil ' kim other than iggy because nicki denied later
all the talk will be about nicki and miley tomorrow . nothing else has been talk worthy . vmas
alone at a mcdonald 's . few vestibules away people are talking about mar 's presidency run while the other table talks about nicki 's vma feud .
"and that nicki and miley ' beef ' looked toooo staged , nicki smiled , miley response was too instant ( like she been practisin it ) .. c'mon mtv"
ask a kid watching the vmas where they were when nicki called miley out ... now ask them what happen nov ( crickets ) . sosad
azealia banks may find herself in another hot situation after she involved herself in the miley cyrus and nicki ... <url>
"be prepared to listen about nicki and miley tomorrow at school , or maybe kanye"
because nicki actually looked up to kim but kim came at her for no reason ? ? why argue with someone you idolized ? <url>
"but miley , what is good ? i think nicki needs an answer on her desk by tomorrow morning if you wanna keep ya scalp ."
ca n't wait to see the lame ass ' think pieces ' about how nicki is ' an angry black woman ' and how she was ' mean ' to miley tomorrow
"i do have some complaints about this this beautiful sunday night . first , miley handled that well . nicki should be ... <url>"
"i do n't get too riled up , because nicki may be dancing with miley onstage at the next awards show . vmas"
i do n't think nicki 's pregnant . stomach was flat again in the side view . think she was just sticking her butt out in the st pic .
i feel like i 'm in rd grade again watching the vmas . kanye is to trump as nicki is to miley .
i just realized today is sunday y' all nicki and kanye were preachin to the choir
i like meek mills when he raps because he talks like a handicapped th grader ... how do he and nicki hold conversations ? ? ?
i like to avoid my monday 's like miley avoided nicki at the vmas
i may even include a rendition of nicki 's ' death stare ' she shot at miley last night
i remember when haterade by nicki pharrell and gucci was my ringtone in the th grade
"i start school tomorrow and i 'm here watching kanye rant , miley and nicki go at it and tori kelly blow the roof out of the vmas"
i still think they should have let nicki continue what she was going to say rather then cut her off cuz it may hurt miley 's feelings
"i still would like a nicki follow , but if she followed me , she 'd just be a flop that followed me . <url>"
i thought this may have been entertaining after nicki 's moment but it 's actually very painful
i was just stalking nicki 's ig and now i have to work out for hours tomorrow
i wonder if they 'll cut out nicki calling miley out when they air it again tomorrow
"i 'm a bit annoyed about what miley said about nicki . taylor started the pop star against pop star war , nicki did n't even sat her name"
i 'm literally nervous for what kanye may say tonight ... he more of a loose cannon than nicki
if i rise tomorrow and there 's no sign of ) zayn throwing a public tantrum or ) nicki taking over the world then i 'm checking out of life
it looks like nicki may be very small in person . well small with a big butt lol .
it 's monday and i just need to know the status of this nicki and miley beef ...
just watched how nicki called out bitch miley cyrus on stage at the vmas . may the one who has the biggest ass wins .
like miley said she did n't look into everything but she thought nicki may have been subbing her but she did n't know for sure . her words .
"lol . you can still watch , nicki asked miley what 's good and called her a bitch ( most interesting part of the show ) <url>"
meek about to have a nd wave coming from twitter bc nicki came harder without a song haha
more like taylor wants to stay the hell away from miley bc she saw how nicki dragged her sunday . <url>
nyfw does n't begin until thursday . y' all gon na get nicki inadvertently cursed out cz mfs gon na think she stayed home .
nicki and miley left nothing to the imagination at sunday night 's vma 's .
"nicki carried taylor so much in that performance , tomorrow she 's going to need a nicki massage . vmas"
nicki dead has n't sat in an audience of an award show ( besides bet ) in awhile . she ca n't be bothered with those yts .
"nicki has no class ? mf got a fish in his avi . you get off to the smell of fish right ? c'mon bitch step ya dick up , tweet @ me . <user>"
nicki is gon na open with trini dem girls on the pinkprint tour in south africa on the nd leg
nicki just gave this pastor a shout out but did n't attend sunday school last sunday . man please .
nicki may have called miley out but miley 's messages tonight were much more powerful than any performance at the vmas
nicki may have forgiven taylor ... but i still think she 's corny for what she did .
"nicki may look hollywood , but you hear every bit of new york when she opens her mouth ."
nicki may need a wardrobe change if she plans on winning anything else tonight . vmas
nicki 's pastor is mad af right now . and it 's sunday smh
no really nicki may have been the only black female artist we saw tonight
not if nicki is gone be in it <url>
okay .... i'll admit it ... taylor did a good job performing with nicki ... i will be performing my own lobotomy tomorrow .... bye
one of pop music 's ugliest feuds kicked off at the mtv video music awards in los angeles on sunday when nicki ... <url>
part of me thinks nicki is so serious about her attitude towards miley tho . she may be cool with her but she was a little serious . vmas
remember that time wayne ran across the show to help nicki up the stairs but tn meek just sat in his seat while my mom had to wait for rebel
remember this when you watch the news stories about nicki tomorrow morning . <url>
school tomorrow is gon na be fired up ha ! you got something to say bad about nicki ? prepare your argument you 're bout to get shut down
snaps to nicki ! i may not like her but get it <url>
so meek just sat on his ass and did n't walk nicki up to the stage ? vmas
stop it nicki said all that behind a smile <url>
taylor told nicki weeks ago she can come on stage if she wins an award & nicki was ' nah bitch i m a bring you on stage so i can do it st '
this may be unexpected but i found a very special lady with similar personalities ! nicki and miley beef is over ! <user>
"tomorrow at work , when people talk to me , i 'm just going to slap my crotch and twerk in response . see if i get the same reaction nicki did ."
"wait , did taylor bring nicki on stage when she won on sunday ? i did n't think so ..."
"watch nicki call miley out . watch miley 's reaction . watch rebel 's ' whoa ' in the background . c'mon , buzzfeed . let us collectively get a life ."
what i love most about this is that every hag will be on dcum tomorrow talking a t how trashy nicki or bey is . when clearly ... #vmas

' what 's good this thursday ? tbt to nicki and miley 's heated exchange at the vmas ! mileywhatsgood ' : <url>

"where 's nicki 's style or her nd mil sold album ? ? keep changing topics when u get clocked , its right here with u <url>"

"<user> liam got tattooed on on his body , zayn left on the th , there are members left , therefore ziam is real ."
<user> hello do you have a dm with zayn ? i am looking for it since forever ... may help me ?
<user> _ <user> ok ... first thing first .. u got ta know the statement was n't made by zayn but management and the sun
<user> <user> <user> that 's why pierrie and zayn are so pale . they have n't been seeing the sun bc they 've been so shady
<user> syco / columbia have ot signed for albums and a greatest hits . that means zayn has to work on the th album or else he breaks+
<user> nd person did n't respond . zayn is gone but do u want calum ?
<user> no offense but zayn left on the th an my organs are on the g r o u n d
<user> what gon na happen tomorrow with zayn ?
<user> i believe zayn 's return is due for jan so he 'll probably be at the rumble . no idea what they 'll do with hideo .
<user> <user> either way its probably true rmbr when the sun said zayn was leaving and we laughed and then zayn left
<user> hold on the source that said zayn dumped perrie over text was also the sun and % of lm fans believe it !
<user> zayn left on the th . i guess i should have added d but
<user> all i 'm thinking about is how zayn left on march th rip
<user> and march is a funny month considering that will be the year anniversary since zayn left
<user> actually now they 're all denying they ever believed the sun when it came to zayn ..... not even they can keep up with their bs
<user> i had to drop a finger cause zayn is gone and it was like march th all over again .
"<user> the sun is shit in general ! they made up bad thing about zayn , the baby news , harry and ' x ' girl every day , homophobic liam"
<user> they did n't believe the sun for a single second about louis becoming a dad but they believe the sun on anything to do with zayn
<user> i just do n't believe the sun bc louis and zayn said not to so i 'm not believing anything until they confirm it
<user> <user> your mate should got through . after all he could sing look at zayn when he st auditioned . x
"<user> if that 's true then zayn has n't left the band so you 're okay . wait till march , life might fall apart , sry"
<user> you think she 's ugly only because zayn may be dating her.most y' all judge them bc you want to be the one dating zayn or whatever
<user> no . the sun is notorious for making up bullshit about zayn including the cheating allegations .
<user> may be they do nt wanna hurt the fans with zayn 's pic with the boys !
<user> me too but zayn was just on a break at st too so idk i 'm still super scared
